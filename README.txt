# Camera
In this project of python you can get some amazing type of camera. I suggest you to try this.

In this project we have four cameras. They are:-

1. Camera
This project is a simple camera which occupies your laptop, computer or os camera using the help of python programming language and if you want to off that camera use your space bar key 

2. Gray camera
This project is a gray coloured camera which occupies your laptop, computer or os camera using the help of python programming language and if you want to off that camera use your space bar key

3. Colourful motion detector camera
This project is a camera that detect your motion if you move it will show you and if you will stop moving it will stop showing you and if you want to off that camera use your space bar key

4. Gray motion detector camera
This project is a camera that detect your motion if you move it will show you and if you will stop moving it will stop showing you and if you want to off that camera use your space bar key. You might think that colourful motion detector camera and gray motion detector camera is same but they are not same they are different. I suggest you to try these both motion detector cameras

hope you will like them
